                  God of War Ragnarök is an action-adventure game developed by
                  Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive
                  Entertainment. It was released worldwide on November 9, 2022,
                  for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, marking the first
                  cross-gen release in the God of War series. It is the ninth
                  installment in the series, the ninth chronologically, and the
                  sequel to 2018's God of War. Loosely based on Norse mythology,
                  the game is set in ancient Scandinavia and features series
                  protagonist Kratos and his teenage son Atreus. Concluding the
                  Norse era of the series, the game covers Ragnarök, the
                  eschatological event which is central to Norse mythology and
                  was foretold to happen in the previous game after Kratos
                  killed the Aesir god Baldur.

                  Minecraft is a video game in which players create and break
                  apart various kinds of blocks in three-dimensional worlds. The
                  game’s two main modes are Survival and Creative. In Survival,
                  players must find their own building supplies and food. They
                  also interact with blocklike mobs, or moving creatures.
                  (Creepers and zombies are some of the dangerous ones.) In
                  Creative, players are given supplies and do not have to eat to
                  survive. They also can break all kinds of blocks immediately.

                  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a 2015 action role-playing game
                  developed and published by CD Projekt. It is the sequel to the
                  2011 game The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings and the third game
                  in The Witcher video game series, played in an open world with
                  a third-person perspective. The games follow the The Witcher
                  series of fantasy novels written by Andrzej Sapkowski. The
                  game takes place in a fictional fantasy world based on Slavic
                  mythology. Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer
                  for hire known as a Witcher, and search for his adopted
                  daughter, who is on the run from the otherworldly Wild Hunt.
                  Players battle the game's many dangers with weapons and magic,
                  interact with non-player characters, and complete quests to
                  acquire experience points and gold, which are used to increase
                  Geralt's abilities and purchase equipment. The game's story
                  has three possible endings, determined by the player's choices
                  at key points in the narrative.

                  Players once again take on the role of the Doom Slayer who
                  battles the demonic forces of Hell, from a first-person
                  perspective. The game continues its predecessor's emphasis on
                  "push-forward" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively
                  engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor.
                  The player has access to various firearms. New movement
                  mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal
                  bars to swing from have also been introduced. Like its
                  predecessor, Doom Eternal invites the player to develop simple
                  tactics. As the game gets harder, the player needs to use the
                  advantages of fight arenas, and their bonuses, in more
                  strategic ways. They also need to decide which enemy has to be
                  killed first and how to move on the battlefield.

              <p>
                Santa Monica Studio has just invited gamer photographers to
                download the new update for God of War Ragnarok. Photo Mode has
                appeared in the biggest hit of PlayStation Studios, thanks to
                which you will prepare a series of beautiful photos. Even before
                the premiere, Santa Monica Studio confirmed that it did not
                manage to prepare Photo Mode for God of War Ragnarok, but the
                game will receive the mode after its debut. Then we informed
                that the option is actually available in the game, but work on
                the proposal has not been completed, so the developers have not
                offered the proposal to the general public.
